RMI4 devices are typically handled by kernel drivers attached to devices on
/sys/bus/rmi.  However, user space programs can access the RMI4 devices
through a /dev interface.

Each registered RMI4 device is assigned a number, starting from 0.  The rmidev
module (if present and loaded) creates a corresponding /dev/rmiX device.  This
device is a flat binary character file that allows you to read, write, and seek
within the register space of the corresponding RMI4 device.

Opening the rmidev file is done just like opening any other file.  For example,
in C you might do the following to open the device file for the first RMI4
device:
    int file;

    file = open("/dev/rmi0", O_RDWR);
    if (file < 0) {
        /* ERROR HANDLING; you can check errno to see what went wrong */
        exit(1);
    }

Once the file is open, you can use read() and write() to access registers in
the RMI4 register map.  Use lseek() to specify the address at which the
read() or write() operation will begin.


NOTES ON ADDRESSING
-------------------

The RMI4 register space is 16 bits wide, supporting 65536 available 8-bit
registers.  This means the range of valid positions within the file is 0
through 65535 (0xFFFF).

Attempting to lseek() to an address of 65536 or higher will return EINVAL.
read() and write() operations that begin at 65536 or higher will return EINVAL.
The result of read() and write() operations that begine at 65535 or below, and
then extend beyond that boundary are undefined.

Although the RMI4 register space supports 65536 registers, not all registers
are defined or mapped on all products.  Undefined or unmapped registers will
usually return zero, but you should not rely on this behavior.  The register
map for a given device may contain 'holes' of unimplemented registers.

If you're not sure what the register map for a given RMI4 device looks like,
you can use the self describing features of RMI4 to determine the register
map (this is what the RMI4 touchscreen driver does), or consult the product
spec and documentation for your product.


BUFFERED REGISTERS
------------------

The RMI4 specification also defines certain special registers, sometimes
referred to as "buffered registers".  Buffered registers allow large amounts
of data to be read or written at a single address in a single read or write
operation.  Reads from (or writes to) buffered registers DO NOT increment the
RMI4 device's internal register pointer.  When reading/writing a buffered
register, you MUST follow these steps:
    (1) lseek() to the buffered register's address
    (2) read/write all data in a single read() or write() call
    (3) lseek() to the address of the next register you wish to read/write

The result of a read or write that extends across a buffered register is
undefined.  It probably won't do what you expect.

The result of trying to use multiple read() or write() calls to access the
data in a buffered register is undefined.  It most certainly won't do what
you expect.

The result of failing to lseek() after reading or writing a buffered register
is undefined.  It probably won't do what you expect.

For more information on buffered registers, please refer to the RMI4
specification.


OPERATIONAL NOTE
----------------

It's important to remember that reading or writing the registers of an RMI4
device using rmidev can change the state of the device.  For example, reading
the F01 interrupt status register has the side effect of clearing the contents
of that register.  If there was a pending interrupt (for example, a finger
position report), information about that interrupt would be lost to the RMI4
touchscreen driver.

For this reason, it is required you disable the RMI4 device before accessing
the sensor via rmidev.  To do this, write 0 to
/sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/enabled before you open the /dev/rmi0 file.
After you close that file, you can write 1 to
/sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/enabled to return the RMI4 device to its enabled
state.

The results of using rmidev to access an RMI4 sensor via rmidev while the
touchscreen driver is enabled are not defined, but it probably won't be pretty.


HANDLING ATTENTION
------------------

RMI4 devices use the gpiolib framework to export their ATTN GPIO to userspace
via sysfs (see Documentation/gpio.txt for more information about gpiolib).
For a given RMI4 device, the gpiolib interfaces can be found in
/sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensorNN/attn/ where NN is the number of the RMI4 sensor.

Disabling the RMI4 device will also cause it to release the ATTN IRQ.  This
will make it possible for a user space program to write to .../attn/edge file
and then use poll() monitor the .../attn/value for changes in the state of
the ATTN pin.

Once you are done with ATTN, you MUST write 'none' to the .../attn/edge file
in order to release the IRQ.  This MUST be done before you re-enable the RMI4
device, otherwise the touchscreen driver will not be able to re-acquire the
ATTN IRQ, and your device will be a brick.


PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
-----------------------

Suppose you want to build a user space program to use rmidev to access an
RMI4 device, and use changes in ATTN to determine when to read the F01
interrupt status register.  Follow the steps below to disable the device
and obtain access.

    1) write 0 to /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/enabled
    2) open /dev/rmi0
    3) open /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/value
    4) write both to /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/edge

Then enter an operating mode like this.
    1) poll() the /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/value
    2) lseek() to 0 and read() /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/value
       whenever gpiolib indicates there is a change in state
    3) if ATTN is asserted (usually this will be value == 0) read the
       interrupt status register(s)
    4) perform appropriate actions
    5) go back to (1)

When you're all done, perform the following steps IN ORDER:

    1) close /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/value
    2) close /dev/rmi0
    3) write none to /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/attn/edge
    4) write 1 to /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensor00/enabled
