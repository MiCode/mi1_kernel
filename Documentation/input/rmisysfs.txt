The RMI4 driver exposes an extensive set of informational and control
parameters via sysfs.

General parameters for a particular RMI4 device are found in
/sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensorXX/, where XX is a the device's ID as a two digit
number (padded with leading zeros).  Function specific parameters associated
with a particular RMI sensor are found in /sys/bus/rmi/devices/sensorXX/fnYY/,
where XX is a the device's ID as a two digit number (padded with leading zeros)
and YY is the hexdecimal function number (for example, fn11 for RMI function
F11).

Although you could use this sysfs interface to configure an RMI4 device on
system startup, that is not recommended.  Use the existing platform data and
board file structures to specify the initial operating parameters, instead.


General Parameters
==================

hasbsr (RO) - Reads back as 1 if the device supports the bus select register
(see below), 0 otherwise.

bsr (RW) - This contains the current value of the device's Bus Select Register
(BSR), if it is present.  The Bus Select Register is of interest only when
reflashing the device.  See the RMI4 Specification for details.

enabled (RW) - Writing 1 to this enables the RMI4 driver, writing 0 to this
disables it.  When disabled, the RMI4 driver completes any pending activities,
suspends any current threads, stops polling (if applicable) and releases the
ATTN IRQ (if applicable).  This can be useful when another driver, such as
rmidev, wants to interact with the device.  The RMI4 driver is enabled by
default at start up.

phy (RO) - Presents information about the physical connection of this device.
It has one line, with the format
    prot tx_count tx_bytes tx_errors rx_count rx_bytes rx_errors attn
Where
    prot is one of i2c, spi1, or spi2
    tx_count is the number of write operations
    tx_bytes is the number of bytes written
    tx_errors is the number of write operations that encountered errors
    rx_count is the number of read operations
    rx_bytes is the total number of bytes read
    rx_errors is the number of read operations that encountered errors
    attn is the number of times the ATTN line interrupt has been seen
All counts are 64-bit unsigned values, and are set to zero when the physical
layer driver is initialized.

version(RO) - Displays RMI4 driver version info.



F01 Device Control Parameters
=============================

chargerinput (RW) - User space programs can use this to tell the sensor that
the system is plugged into an external power source (as opposed to running on
batteries).  This allows the sensor firmware to make necessary adjustments
for the current capacitence regime.  Write 1 to this when the system is using
external power, write 0 to this when the system is running on batteries.

configured (RO) - Shows the current state of the configured bit.  This will be
1 most of the time (indicating the device has been appropriately configured),
but will switch to 0 briefly if the sensor experiences a firmware or ASIC
reset event.

datecode (RO) - the date on which the module was manufactured.

flashprog (RO) - Defines the current device operating mode. The flashprog flag
is set if the normal operation of the device is suspended because the device is
in a flash programming enabled state.

manufacturer (RO) - This is the identity of the manufacturer of the device,
as obtained from F01_RMI_Query0.

nosleep (RW) - Writing 1 to this parameter disables all normal firmware
powersaving behaviors and forces the device to run at full power without
sleeping.  The default state for this bit is 0.

productinfo (RO) - the product info bytes, as determined from F01_RMI_Query2
and F01_RMI_Query3 registers.

productID (RO) - A string of up to 10 characters, identifying the product.

reportrate (RW) - This is the current value of the RMI4 ReportRate bit
(F01_RMI_Ctrl0, bit 6).  The meaning of this bit is very much device-dependent.
Please see the RMI4 specification for details.

reset (WO) - Writing a 1 to this write only register forces the device to reset.

sleepmode (RW) - Controls power management on the device.  Writing 0 to this
parameter puts the device into its normal operating mode.  Writing 1 to this
parameter fully disables touch sensors and similar inputs - no touch data will
be reported from the device in this mode.  Writing 2 or 3 to this device may
or may not have an effect, depending on the particular device - see the product
specification for your sensor for details.

statuscode (RO) - Reports the most recent device status, such as invalid
configuration, device reset, CRC failure, and so on.  Please se the RMI4
specification for details.

unconfigured (RO) - This is the opposite of the configured bit, described above.


F11 2D Sensing Parameters
=========================

swap (RW) - Writing 1 to this parameter swaps the X and Y axis as reported by
the device, rotating the reported coordinates by 90 degrees.  This can be
useful when installing a landscape sensor over a portrait display, for example.
The default state for this parameter is 0.  If enabled, swap is applied before
any other transformation.

flip (RW) - This parameter is a pair of single binary digits (for example,
"0 0" or "1 0"), corresponding to the X and Y axis.  Writing a 1 for a
particular axis will invert the coordinates reported by the device along
that axis.  For example writing "0 1" to this parameter will flip the Y axis
top to bottom, but leave the X axis unchanged.  If enabled, flip is applied
after swap and before offset.

offset (RW) - This is a pair of values that will be SUBTRACTED from the X and
Y coordinates, respectively.  If non-zero, offset will be applied after flip
and before clip.  The default value for offset is 0 for both X and Y.

clip (RW) - This is a set of four unsigned values in the range [0..65535],
representing the lower bounds on X, the upper bounds on X, the lower bounds on
Y, and the upper bounds on Y.  Coordinates will be clipped to these ranges.  If
enabled, clip is the final transformation to be applied to the coordinates.
The default upper and lower bounds for clip are 0 and 65535 respectively for
both axes.

maxPos (RW) - Contains two values specifying the the maximum reported
coordinates for X and Y axes, respectively.

relreport (RW) - Writing 1 to this parameter enables relative motion reporting.
The default state for this parameter is 0.


F19 Capacitive Button Parameters
================================

button_count (RO) - Tells you how many buttons this device supports.  Buttons
are numbered from 0 through button_count-1.

buttonMap (RW) - This consists of button_count entries, showing which keys each
button is mapped to.  Writing to this parameter changes the button mappings.
When writing, you must provide a mapping for each capacitive button.


F34 Flash Memory Management Parameters
======================================

blocksize (RO) - The number of bytes in one data block. When programming the
firmware, the data should be broken into blocks of this size and each block
programmed individually.

bootloaderid (RW) - Two ASCII characters identifying the particular bootloader
version.

cmd (RW) - Write to this parameter to send a flash control operation command.
See rmi_f34.h for #defines of available commands, and the RMI4 specification
for details on their meaning.

configblockcount (RO) -  the number of blocks in a configuration image.
blocksize * configblockcount == total number of bytes in a configuration image.

data (RW) - Write blocks of image or configuration data to this during the
reflash process.  You can also use this to read the configuration blocks.

imageblockcount (RO) - The number of blocks in a firmware image. blocksize *
imageblockcount == total number of bytes in a firmware image area.

status (RO) - This parameter, at the completion of a flash operation, indicates
the success or failure of the
operation.


F54 Diagnostic Reporting Parameters
